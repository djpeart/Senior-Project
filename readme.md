# Senior Project

Welcome to my Senior Project.

This software is meant to be used by a small business that rents things out to customers. It keeps track of customers and the buisness's assets, keeps track of who has what, and gets their total bills.

## Details

### What can it do?

This website has the following features:
*Access the system from any device with a modern web browser (its mobile friendly!)
*Log in and view what the user has been permissioned to view
*Create and update records for customer information, payments, and assets.
*See it all in an easy to read format

### Personal Note
For my senior project, I decided to try my hand at something different. I wanted to make something useful. That's where this software came from.

I didn't really know much about PHP or web development at first, so I learned a lot in the creation of this site.

### Access
If you'd like to see in action (and my server is up), check it out [here](http://danpeart.ddns.net)
